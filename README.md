# Perceptron
A project I began in Honors Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Neural Networks, taught by Dr. Eric R. Nelson.

This is a multilayer perceptron which initially determined the solutions to simple logic operations, like AND, OR, and XOR. Now, it takes in small bitmap images and uses the backpropagation algorithm to try and recreate these images.
When recreating images, the perceptron trains on the same image it is given as input.

The design document notes are stored in the main directory, beginning from index 0 in the order that they should be read through.
